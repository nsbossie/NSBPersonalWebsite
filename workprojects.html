    <h2> Office-to-Residential (O2R) Conversions</h2>
        <h3> Abstract </h3>
        <p> Office vacancy is high, housing demand is high. O2R is an obvious solution but conversions face many challenges. This study explores the viability of these projects and what levers are available to federal, state, and local governments if they want to encourage O2R conversions.</p>
        <h3> Team and timing</h3>
        <p> The research team conducting this study includes Gensler Associates, Brookings Institute, HR&A, and HUD. The final report is expected to be completed in summer of 2025 and published in fall 2025.</p>

    <h2> Missing Middle Housing (MMH) Finance </h2>
        <h3> Abstract </h3>
        <p> Housing markets have not produced substantial new construction of buildings between duplexes and low/mid-rise apartments. Zoning and building code regulations have been large barriers to this type of housing. However, several localities have addressed zoning and regulations to encourage the development of missing middle housing without sucessfully spuring these construction projects. This study will investigate how financial barriers play a role in limiting the supply and development of MMH. </p>
